# Observations and Thoughts

- Drivers tend to underestimate the number of disengagements
    - Example: Brandonee916 [says](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=1641) during one of his drives: "As you guys have noticed, I actually
      haven't disengaged at all.  Up until those two roundabouts [at [16:07](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=967) and [16:37](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=997)],
      there's been no disengagements. I haven't disengaged once. Other than those two roundabouts."
      Actually, the driver had disengaged twice before the two roundabouts,
      at [12:16](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=736) and [15:31](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=931).
- Some drivers feel sad or become silent when too many disengagements
    - Example: TOSV (3 times): "it's a bit of a bummer" (1st DD, 2nd DD, 8:15)
- Some drivers avoid disengagements which is sometimes rude towards other drivers or pedestrians, or miss turns:
    - Example: TOSV at 17:36
    - Brandon and Amazon van
- Time not perfect way to normalize but distance isn’t either
- What is Tesla’s goal? L3 or L5? If former, need better communication with user to help them predict when they might to take over. For instance, if the car showed “allowed surface”, Frenchie could have disengaged sooner w construction workers, or passed garbage truck sooner.
- If L5, obviously right now way too poor, and distance is very large.
