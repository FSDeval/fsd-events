# Observations and Thoughts

- Drivers tend to underestimate the number of disengagements
    - Example: Brandonee916 [says](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=1641) during one of his drives: "As you guys have noticed, I actually
      haven't disengaged at all.  Up until those two roundabouts [at [16:07](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=967) and [16:37](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=997)],
      there's been no disengagements. I haven't disengaged once. Other than those two roundabouts."
      Actually, the driver had disengaged twice before the two roundabouts,
      at [12:16](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=736) and [15:31](https://youtu.be/2syXnikGlYQ?t=931).
- Some drivers feel sad or become silent when too many disengagements
    - Examples:
        - TOSV (3 times): "it's a bit of a bummer" (1st DD, 2nd DD, 8:15)
        - [Trevor Mahlmann](https://youtu.be/xO91orxiG-M?t=472): "It's a bummer. It's really a bummer."
    - They are the less likely to post videos
        - End or one of oissa or dirty videos??
- Some drivers avoid disengagements which is sometimes rude towards other drivers or pedestrians, or miss turns:
    - Example: TOSV at 17:36
    - Brandon and Amazon van
- Time not perfect way to normalize but distance isn’t either
- What is Tesla’s goal? L3 or L5? If former, need better communication with user to help them predict when they might to take over. For instance, if the car showed “allowed surface”, Frenchie could have disengaged sooner w construction workers, or passed garbage truck sooner.
    - If L5, obviously right now way too poor, and distance is very large.
- Need for better communication:
    - [Trevor Mahlmann](https://youtu.be/xO91orxiG-M?t=70): "It doesn't really inspire too much confidence when it doesn't say anything on the screen,
      you know, 'yielding to traffic' or 'slowing for traffic to find a gap' or anything."
- FSD Beta testers might tend to provide unduly positive coverage of FSD Beta's capabilities:
    - [Jeff K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK8jNb_jkz0): "Because I'm a board member of the [Tesla Arizona] club. Initially the beta testers were very sporadic and kind of whoever. Nobody knew there was no rhyme or reason who got to be a beta tester. And you know they just would pick people kind of seemingly at random. But with this release, they want people who were more kind of you know Tesla fans and the people that weren't gonna you know post videos of it like running down you know barricades like it just about did [see 8:01]. They wanted more positive press to get out there before a bunch of negative press about it. So they were very selective and they just wanted club leadership to have it."
